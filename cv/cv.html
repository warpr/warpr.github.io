              MusicBrainz is a community-maintained open source
              encyclopedia of music information.  It consists of a
              website and webservice written in perl, and a fair
              amount of javascript on some of the data entry screens.
              The main site uses PostgreSQL as the back-end database
              and a lucene based search server written in java.

              As a contractor for MetaBrainz I was part of a team of
              three paid developers and a large community of
              volunteers.  I started during a time when we were doing
              a full rewrite of the musicbrainz.org server software,
              which went live on May 2011.  In the following two years
              I've mostly worked on the musicbrainz.org server
              software, working with our community of users and
              clients to fix bugs as they get reported and add
              features.

              As part of a small team of developers with no system
              administrators, I was also responsible for maintaining
              various bits of infrastructure, most importantly nagios
              monitoring of our servers.

              COPE aims to provide insight into corporate data.  To this end,
              COPE has developed a generic online survey tool and a tool for 360
              degree feedback assessments.  My role at COPE was to develop new
              features for these two products, both generic enhancements of the
              software and custom features for specific clients.  I was the
              maintainer of the survey tool codebase.  Technologies used are
              mainly PHP and MySQL, with XML/XSLT to seperate logic from
              presentation, both on screen (HTML/CSS) and on paper (PDF,
              princexml).  </p>

              In addition to being a developer, I was also a network and system
              administrator for a number of machines in a growing network of
              physical and virtual machines, both colocated production servers
              and development servers at our office.  These mainly run Debian
              GNU/Linux, with apache, php, mysql, and other services.
